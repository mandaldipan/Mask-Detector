# Mask-Detector

### About the project :-
- This Project is done with the help of Tenserflow, Keras, Numpy and OpenCV on Python. This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect face masks. The face detection is done with the concept of "**Cascade Classifier**" method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "**Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features**" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

### Data pre-processing and creation of the Mask Detector model.

This Dataset consists of 10,000 images, 5,000 face images with masks and 5,000 without masks. This Dataset is prepared by
